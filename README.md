How to obtain a print copy in plain Bond paper from an Archive of Electrocardiograms (ECG) tracing of an ECG machine 
Normally the ECG machine print each tracing in an special ECG paper which has become very expensive in my Country. My ECG machine also saves each tracing in an Archive so can transfer the tracing to an USB pen drive. Problem is that the resulting file comes as a .txd file (SierraArchive.txd) and my PC (Windows 7 y W-10 has been been unable to open it. If I succeed I will be able to print the resulting ECG tracing in plain Bond paper and save money for me & my patients. Any help to obtain an App to open the .txd file? Thanks
