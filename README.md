How to obtain a print copy in plain Bond paper from an Archive of Electrocardiograms (ECG) tracing of an ECG machine 
Normally the ECG machine print each tracing in an special ECG paper which has become very expensive in my Country. My ECG machine also saves each tracing in an Archive so can transfer the tracing to an USB pen drive. Problem is that the resulting file comes as a .txd file (SierraArchive.txd) and my PC (Windows 7 y W-10 has been been unable to open it. If I succeed I will be able to print the resulting ECG tracing in plain Bond paper and save money for me & my patients. Any help to obtain an App to open the .txd file? Thanks
My Philips PageWriter Touch Cardiograph says:"The waveform in the Philips XML ECG is encoded and compressed using proprietary
algorithms. Used mostly in a research setting, the XML Decompressor
(PhilipsXMLECGdecompressor.exe) takes a standard Philips XML ECG file (with 12 to 16 leads
of data) with compressed and base64-encoded ECG waveforms and creates a corresponding
Philips XML ECG file with uncompressed, plain text, or base64-encoded waveform sample
values. The utility stores the new decompressed files in C:\PhilipsECG\Decompressed.
The Decompressor processes XML ECGs acquired from the following Philips sources:
PageWriter Touch or PageWriterTrim cardiographs, MRx defibrillators, IntelliVue Bedside
Monitor/Information Center with 12-Lead capability, and the TracemasterVue ECG
Management System. These sources export ECGs using the Philips XML schema file
SierraXML.xsd version 1.02 or 1.03, or PhilipsXML.xsd version 1.04, depending on the device.
Check the device documentation for the XML version of the output.
You can run this utility manually, or make it part of an automated workflow by editing the task
script. For details, see “Enabling and Disabling Utilities in the Task Script” on page 3-53."
